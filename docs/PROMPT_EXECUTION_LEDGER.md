# Prompt Execution Ledger (Mule Activities)

This document captures successful user prompts across this engagement, execution windows, command-level implementation patterns, and failure-to-fix history.

## 1) Scope and Method

- Source of prompts: user conversation timeline for this project.
- "Time taken" values:
  - **Observed**: from command/runtime windows captured during execution.
  - **Approx**: based on bounded implementation/deploy phases when exact timers are unavailable.
- This ledger focuses on **Mule-related** activities and excludes generic chat-only prompts.

## 2) KT Applied from Prior Agent Streams

- **RAML developer stream KT applied**
  - Use Design Center project upload flow to keep RAML structure intact.
  - Publish API spec to Exchange as `rest-api` with explicit versioning.
  - Maintain RAML + examples + exchange modules together for portability.
- **Mule app developer stream KT applied**
  - Use CloudHub 2 deployment + post-deploy log pull for runtime diagnosis.
  - Verify scheduler and integration flows through runtime log evidence (not just deployment status).
  - Keep environment-specific config pattern: `config-${mule.env}.properties` and secure variant.

## 3) Successful Prompt Ledger

| # | User Prompt (normalized) | Executed Solution | Primary Commands/Actions | Time Taken |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Implement DataWeave use cases as business logic mappings | Added DW flows/resources and wired them to endpoints in Mule XML | Mule XML + `.dwl` updates, build/package checks | Approx 1.5-2.5 hrs |
| 2 | Continue TDLC step-by-step | Iterative build, local test, deployment, and hardening workflow | `mvn clean package`, deployment scripts, API tests | Multi-phase across sessions |
| 3 | Skip MUnit and focus local app testing | Shifted priority to endpoint and flow-level validation | PowerShell regression script + cURL checks | Approx 45-90 mins per cycle |
| 4 | Fix destination filter and delete-not-found behavior | Patched implementation flow error/otherwise handling | `implementation.xml` logic updates, redeploy, smoke tests | Approx 1-2 hrs |
| 5 | Convert property management to env-specific | Enforced env + secure property split and runtime key pattern | Updated property files + global config references | Approx 30-60 mins |
| 6 | Add scheduler-based service | Implemented `scheduledOperationalHeartbeat` with DB check and logs | `ops.xml` flow, config properties, redeploy | Approx 45-75 mins |
| 7 | Enable external logging | Added config-driven outbound HTTP log call path | `ops.xml` HTTP request + config keys | Approx 45-60 mins |
| 8 | Create Postman collection with endpoint coverage | Updated/maintained collections for local and CloudHub | Postman JSON generation/updates | Approx 30-60 mins |
| 9 | Apply data privacy handling | Moved sensitive values to secure properties and runtime masked secureProperties | Deployment properties and secure config handling | Approx 45-90 mins |
|10 | Add proper transaction-aware loggers | Added `transactionId`/correlation logging in core flows | Logger updates in interface/ops/impl flows | Approx 30-60 mins |
|11 | Deploy and test on CloudHub | Deployed `american-airlines-info-app-dev` and validated health | `deploy-cloudhub2.ps1`, CH2 checks, endpoint probes | Observed single deploy cycles ~4-9 mins |
|12 | Perform Design Center sync | Created and uploaded `american-airlines-info-api` project | `anypoint-cli-v4 designcenter project create/upload` | Observed ~20-30 secs per command |
|13 | Publish to Exchange | Published API spec as new version when existing version locked | `publish-api-spec.ps1` (`1.0.1`) | Observed ~20-40 secs |
|14 | Continue APIM troubleshooting | Isolated registration behavior via minimal app and log analysis | CH2 log download, APIM instance APIs, redeploy loops | Multi-hour diagnostic stream |
|15 | Remove minimal/irrelevant artifacts and keep actual app | Deleted minimal deployment + duplicate API instances/contracts | AMC/APIM delete + contract revoke APIs | Observed ~1-3 mins each API task |
|16 | Test all services/schedulers/DWL endpoints last time | Confirmed scheduler by repeated heartbeat logs and validated DW endpoints | CH2 log grep + cURL endpoint tests | Approx 30-45 mins |
|17 | Create full documentation set | Added HLD/LLD, lifecycle docs, Exchange doc, resource index, metrics | Markdown doc generation and structuring | Approx 1-2 hrs |
|18 | Push to remote git repo | Initial commit and push to provided GitHub URL | `git add/commit`, `git remote add`, `git push -u origin master` | Observed push ~35-40 secs |

## 4) Commands Executed (Representative)

### 4.1 Build/Deploy

- `./scripts/deploy-cloudhub2.ps1 -MuleEnv dev -MuleKey cursur12345678 -ApiAutodiscoveryId <id> -PlatformClientId <id> -PlatformClientSecret <secret> -SkipTests`
- `mvn -s .\\munit-settings.xml -Pcloudhub-dev clean package mule:deploy ...`

### 4.2 CloudHub and API Platform Operations

- `Invoke-RestMethod` token acquisition:
  - `POST https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/v2/oauth2/token`
- Deployments:
  - `GET/DELETE .../amc/application-manager/api/v2/organizations/{org}/environments/{env}/deployments`
- API Manager instances/contracts:
  - `GET/PATCH/DELETE .../apimanager/api/v1/organizations/{org}/environments/{env}/apis/{apiId}`
  - `.../contracts/{contractId}`

### 4.3 Logs and Runtime Verification

- Endpoint probes with timeout-safe `curl.exe`:
  - `GET /api/flights`
  - `POST /dw/simple`, `/dw/complex`, `/dw/multi1`, `/dw/multi2`

### 4.4 Design Center and Exchange

- `anypoint-cli-v4 designcenter project create "american-airlines-info-api" --type raml ...`
- `anypoint-cli-v4 designcenter project upload "american-airlines-info-api" "src/main/resources/api" ...`
- `./scripts/publish-api-spec.ps1 ... -AssetVersion 1.0.1`

- `git add .`
- `git commit ...`
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/kedarawasthi/test-mule-cursur-project.git`
- `git push -u origin master`

## 5) Failure Log and Resolutions

| Failure | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| APIM remained `unregistered` despite app running | Control-plane/runtime handshake inconsistency and evolving runtime property/config state | Deferred APIM pairing as requested; preserved actual app runtime and removed noisy duplicate/minimal artifacts |
| `401 Unauthorized` for certain Maven artifacts | Credential scope/repo auth mismatch for EE repository | Avoided blocking path for current scope; continued deploy flows not requiring new EE artifact pull |
| PowerShell heredoc / `&&` parser failures | Bash syntax used in PowerShell context | Switched to PowerShell-safe multiline variable commit message |
| Git `Filename too long` | Deep `exchange_modules` path on Windows | Added ignore entry for exchange_modules and completed commit |
| DW endpoint transient `500` during shell tests | Escaped JSON payload formatting in inline shell strings | Switched to payload files / correctly escaped bodies; all DW endpoints passed |
| Existing Exchange version publish conflict (`409`) | Version already published | Published next version (`1.0.1`) successfully |

## 6) Net Outcome

- Actual app deployed and running.
- Minimal troubleshooting artifacts removed.
- Scheduler and DW services validated.
- Design Center synced and Exchange published.
- Documentation and repository push completed.
