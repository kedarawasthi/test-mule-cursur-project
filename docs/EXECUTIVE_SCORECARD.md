# Executive Scorecard - Cursor TDLC Performance

## 1) Overall Assessment

| Dimension | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Delivery Completion | Strong end-to-end completion for build, deploy, documentation, and platform publication |
| Production Readiness | High for core app runtime, scheduler operations, and API/service functionality |
| Governance Readiness | Moderate; APIM registration stabilization intentionally deferred |
| Documentation Completeness | High; HLD, LLD, lifecycle, resource index, prompt ledger, and metrics complete |
| Operational Confidence | High for CloudHub runtime stability and periodic scheduler health checks |

## 2) Cursor Capability Snapshot (0-4 Scale)

| Capability Area | Score | Executive Note |
|---|---:|---|
| Requirement to Feature Translation | 4 | Converted broad asks to executable phases with minimal back-and-forth |
| Design Documentation Generation | 4 | Produced functional + technical design documentation with architecture views |
| Build and Implementation | 4 | Delivered Mule flows, DW logic, scripts, and environment-specific configuration |
| Test Scenario Generation | 3 | Strong functional validation; MUnit automation impacted by repository/auth constraints |
| Deployment Execution | 4 | Repeated successful CloudHub2 deployments with runtime verification |
| Exchange and Design Center Operations | 4 | RAML synced to Design Center and published to Exchange |
| API Manager and Runtime Operations | 3 | Runtime operations strong; APIM registration requires separate stabilization stream |

## 3) Task-Level Score Highlights (1-10 Scale)

| Task Cluster | Cursor Score | Effort Reduction | Leadership Summary |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Requirements and Design | 8.5 | 45-55% | Clear gain in converting intent to architecture and implementation artifacts |
| API and Mule Build Tasks | 8.0 | 40-50% | Strong acceleration in flow development, error handling, and DW implementation |
| Testing and Validation | 7.0 | 20-55% | Functional and Postman coverage strong; MUnit maturity constrained by environment |
| Deployment and Runtime Ops | 8.5 | 40-50% | Reliable deployment + log-based verification loop |
| Platform/Governance | 7.0 | 20-55% | Excellent Exchange operations; APIM stabilization remains targeted follow-up item |

## 4) Delivery KPIs from This Engagement

| KPI | Result |
|---|---|
| Actual App Runtime | `american-airlines-info-app-dev` running on CloudHub 2.0 |
| Scheduler Validation | Recurring heartbeat success logs observed over multiple intervals |
| DW Endpoint Validation | `/dw/simple`, `/dw/complex`, `/dw/multi1`, `/dw/multi2` validated with correct payloads |
| Design Center Sync | Completed (`american-airlines-info-api`) |
| Exchange Publish | Completed (`american-airlines-info-api:1.0.1`) |
| Documentation Pack | Completed (Markdown + consolidated `.docx`) |
| GitHub Push | Completed to target repository |

## 5) Risks and Follow-up Recommendations

| Priority | Item | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| High | APIM registration remains unregistered | Run dedicated APIM stabilization sprint with control-plane handshake trace and policy replay |
| Medium | MUnit execution variability due repo/auth | Standardize enterprise Maven credential path and CI secret handling |
| Medium | Long Windows path handling in nested RAML modules | Keep exchange module paths excluded from git where non-essential; package through publish script |
| Low | Documentation refresh drift over future changes | Re-run `scripts/generate-doc-pack.py` as release checklist step |

## 6) Executive Conclusion

Cursor delivered substantial acceleration across the Mule TDLC lifecycle, especially in build, deployment, runtime operations, and documentation. The project is operationally stable for the actual application and highly documented for handoff. The only significant deferred stream is API Manager registration stabilization, which is isolated and can be tackled as a targeted next phase without blocking current runtime service operations.
